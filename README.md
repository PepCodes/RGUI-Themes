# RGUI Themes for RetroArch
A series of custom themes for recent versions of RetroArch's RGUI menu driver that combine classic influences with original artwork. Each theme supports text shadows and comes in centered and full-width variants, the former of which are shown below. While particle animations may look alright, these themes were not designed with them in mind.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repo or download it as a .ZIP archive.
2. Merge the "rgui" folder with that found in whichever "assets" folder you have configured for RetroArch.
3. If you haven't already, change RetroArch's menu driver to RGUI via the <i>Settings -> Drivers -> Menu</i> option.
4. Restart RetroArch.
5. Enable custom themes by setting <i>Settings -> User Interface -> Appearance -> Menu Color Theme</i> to "Custom".
6. Pick from any of your newly installed themes using the <i>Custom Menu Theme Preset</i> option. Be sure to navigate to the "assets/rgui" folder, and to choose the variant that matches your setting for <i>Menu Aspect Ratio</i>. 4:3 is compatible with both variants.

## Known Compatibility Issues
<b>Nintendo 2DS/3DS Family</b>
<ul>
	<li>Due to its screen resolution of 400x240, only the 4:3 and 16:10 theme variants are supported.</li>
</ul>
